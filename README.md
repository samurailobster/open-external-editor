# Raison D'être
Godot's script editor is quite good, but if you're coming from Vim or Emacs, moving around can feel sluggish.
It's already possible to write scripts in an external editor, but there's no way to quickly switch back to the built-in
editor (for, say, debugging) without opening the editor settings and disabling the external editor.

This plugin gives you the best of both worlds by adding a button to the top-right of the built-in script editor that opens the current script in your defined external editor.
When you save the script, Godot will detect the change and automatically reload it.

# Compatibility
This plugin was written and tested in 3.0 stable. I can't guarantee that it will work in 2.1 or any unstable versions.

# Setup
1. Create a folder named `addons` in your project's base folder and clone this repository into it.
The result should look like `.../my-project/addons/open-external-editor/`
2. In the editor settings (Editor->Editor Settings), find the section for defining an external editor (Text Editor->External).
Make sure `Use External Editor` is **unchecked**, or the plugin won't do anything. `Exec Path` and `Exec Flags` should be set based
on what editor you want to use (see below for common examples).
3. (optional) Change the keyboard shortcut. By default this is `Ctrl+E`. To change it, edit `open_external_editor.gd`
in the plugin folder. At the top are two const variables that define the scancode and modifiers (flags are supported for the modifiers).
4. Enable the plugin in the Plugin tab of the project settings. A new button should appear in the top-right corner of
the script editor.
